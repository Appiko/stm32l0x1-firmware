# Repository for the firmware application for systems based on STM32L0x1 application
This is the first draft structure for this repository. Developers still can use [STM32CubeMX]
(https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). But then developers has to put files in different folders
and also developers have to do some other changes while creating the projects through STM32CubeMX.
